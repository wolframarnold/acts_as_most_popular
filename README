ActsAsMostPopular
=================

A plugin to solve a common scalability problem on social networking applications.
It caches joins between a table of viewable entities (e.g. a user profile, images, posts, videos,...)
and another table that tracks user activity on that entity (e.g. viewings, commenting, ratings,...)
where the intention is to display a list of viewables in sorted order depending on the amount of
activity on it, e.g. a ranking of the most viewed posts, most commented videos, etc.

When viewings are added, the plugin keeps the most_popular index automatically updated.

ActsAsMostPopular is built on top of Cache Money which must be installed.  You can get it here:
http://github.com/nkallen/cache-money


Example
=======

Add the following declaration to the viewable model.  We'll use an Item model for the viewable entity and Viewings
for the activity:

class Item < ActiveRecord::Base

  has_many :viewings   # Note: This declaration must _precede_ the acts_as_most_popular declaration!

  acts_as_most_popular :activity_class => Viewing,
                       :limit => 5,
                       :db_finder_args => { :select => 'item_id, COUNT(*) AS activity_count',
                                            :group => 'item_id' }
end


All parameters are required.

:activity_class is the model class that tracks the user activity.

:limit is the number of results you want (number of Upload instances to be returned). The limit will
also be appended to the :db_finder_args.

:db_finder_args are the arguments for the database calculation of the statistics. These will be used in a call to
activity_class.find(db_finder_args) and the result will be used to initialize the cache.  It's important that
there be a count named "activity_count".  :order => 'activity_count DESC' and :limit from above will be appended
to the arguments.

Usage:
======

Item.most_popular => returns a list of 5 (or whatever limit is) Upload instances from cache 

Prerequisites
=============

Cache Money installed.
A has_many relationship from the viewable entitiy to the activity class must be declared, e.g.:
class Item
  has_many :viewings
end
The plugin will add after_add and after_remove hooks to the association, therefore the has_many association _must_ come before the acts_as_most_popular declaration.

TODO
====
Handle updating of join index when activity count shrinks
More test coverage if association callbacks are already defined
